            <blockquote>So why do I talk about the benefits of failure? Simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me. Had I really succeeded in anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena where I believed I truly belong.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>Life is difficult, and complicated, and beyond anyone's total control, and the humility to know that will enable you to survive its vicssitudes.</blockquote>
